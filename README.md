# Ideal-gas-calculator-C++
c++ ideal gas calculator which allows calculation of values PV= NRT in kelvin
ALLOWS EXITING OF PROGRAM AS WELL AS USER INPUTTING AND OPTIONS
also some nice ascii art along with the program and an "option map" this is just a rough calculator it's unfinished
but it works alright and ill be updating it in the future.   On top of this i didnt actually see any c++ rep's for this so another reason why is This for me was just to automate any college work for physics.

THERE  IS SO SO MUCH BETTER WAYS TO WRITE THIS...like all the include statments al the dead functions which arent even used etc


-----
ADDITIONAL CHANGES: adding an ava function when called can work out the ammount of particles ie 6.02 x10^23 x mol
(i think) im not the best at chemistry as i take physics courses...
but on the whole this is my code feel free to let me know what i could do to improve it as i wanna improve my c++ coding of programs and other languages in general.
feel free to use this rep ill prolly leeave it open im pressed on time so enjoy my code

might learn how to turn this into an app usinng android studio and then update

stay good folks
